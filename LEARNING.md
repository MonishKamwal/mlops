# LEARNING.md — things learned building this

Learning journal, newest first. Each entry: what happened, what was learned, why it
matters. This feeds the portfolio's Journey/devlog section (PLAN.md Phase 4). Claude:
add an entry whenever a task teaches a concept that wasn't obvious going in.

## 2026-07-03 — AWS account plans, billing guardrails, and regions

- **AWS revamped its free tier in July 2025.** New accounts choose a *free plan* or
  *paid plan*. Free plan: $100 credits (+ up to $100 earnable), 6-month window, account
  **cannot incur charges**, and credit-hungry services are blocked outright. Upgrading
  directly to paid keeps remaining credits; upgrading via Organizations forfeits them.
  Discovered mid-setup — this project's account is on the free plan.
- **CloudWatch billing alarms have two hidden prerequisites:** they only exist in
  **us-east-1** (billing metrics are published nowhere else), and the metric doesn't
  exist at all until "Receive CloudWatch billing alerts" is enabled under *Billing
  preferences → Alert preferences* (then takes minutes–hours to appear). On a free-plan
  account the metric is moot anyway — it reads $0 by construction — so the alarm is
  deferred until the paid-plan upgrade. AWS Budgets track credit burn instead.
- **"Regions aren't enabled for this account" is (usually) not an error.** Regions
  launched after March 2019 are *opt-in* and show as disabled for every account;
  default regions like us-east-1 are always enabled and can't be turned off.
- **Guardrails before resources, in practice:** budgets and alerts were configured
  before a single piece of infrastructure existed. Being responsible for things outside
  code — the ops half of MLOps — starts on day one, not after the first bill.
